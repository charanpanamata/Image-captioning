The Model Architecture Module defines the architecture of the image captioning model. It consists of an image feature extraction submodule using ResNet50 and a text feature extraction submodule using tokenization and word embedding. The image feature extraction submodule processes the input images through a pre-trained ResNet50 model to obtain image features. The text feature extraction submodule tokenizes and embeds the captions using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. These features are then passed through a combined decoder, consisting of a dense layer, LSTM layer, and softmax output layer, to generate captions. The model is compiled using categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Finally, the model architecture is defined using the Keras functional API, with the image features and input sequences as inputs and the predicted output sequences as the model's output.
